# space-tube
Group to Group communication using matrix bridges

Space Tube is a discord bot that relays conversations from one discord server to another, turning messages from individuals within a group into messages from that group posted in both groupsâ€™s servers.

It relies heavily on the work of [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), specifically the [javascript SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk) and the set of [ansible scripts for managing a homeserver](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy).

## Set-up Instructions

* Create a homeserver and enable discord bridging.

* More stuff I can't recall right now

* `yarn install`

## Run instructions

`yarn start`
